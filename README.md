### Perfect software development lifecycle doesn't exi...
This list is not complete, nor ordered by priority. Not all points are easily applicable everywhere (`it depends`). Just a bunch of topics I personally value during creation of digital products. 

From my experience, these dramatically improve developer experience, minimize lead time and failure rate of the changes. Business people love it too. 

- true agility requires technical excellence
- you build it, you own it, you run it
- developers drive architecture - architect is a role, not a full time job
- tradeoffs are essential part of this job
- Trunk Based Development with short-lived branches
- pushing directly to master is not a crime
- master/main always shippable
- optimize for fast feedback, minimize time from commit to prod
- boring deployments
- exciting releases
- engineers talking to users
- DORA metrics may be useful
- 100% test coverage doesn't prove anything, but 0% means something
- good monitoring is as important (sometimes even more) as test coverage 
- pairing for new code or at least sync code review > async pull requests
- KISS > DRY, especially in tests
- automated tests, TDD when it makes sense, testing diamond/pyramid
- automation ftw (ci, cd, local environment, database migration, security scans, code style checks)
- PR is not a place for code style discussions
- feature packaging over package by layer
- up-to-date runtimes and dependencies
- TestContainers and Docker FTW
- not every commit needs jira ticket
- not every project needs jira
